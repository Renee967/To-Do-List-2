# To-Do-List-2

Modify ToDo lab as follows:       
1. create a pointer pList that will point to an array of tasks.       
2. pass pList instead of tasks in all the functions.       
3. In all functions accept the parameter as a pointer instead of an array
         Example:       
        void getData(Task *pList, int size)        {
         ...
        }
